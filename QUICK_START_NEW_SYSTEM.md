## 📡 New API Endpoints

### Employee Actions
```javascript
// Frontend usage (already implemented in all pages)
import newAttendanceService from '../services/newAttendanceService';

// Punch in
await newAttendanceService.punchIn('Office');

// Start break
await newAttendanceService.startBreak('Break Room', 'Lunch');

// End break
await newAttendanceService.endBreak('Office');

// Punch out
await newAttendanceService.punchOut('Office');

// Get today's status
const response = await newAttendanceService.getTodayStatus();

// Get weekly summary
const summary = await newAttendanceService.getMyWeeklySummary(startDate, endDate);
```

### Admin Actions
```javascript
// Get daily report (all employees)
const report = await newAttendanceService.getDailyReport(new Date());

// Get active employees
const active = await newAttendanceService.getActiveEmployees();

// Manual punch for employee
await newAttendanceService.manualPunchAction(
  userId,
  'PUNCH_IN',
  timestamp,
  { location: 'Office', notes: 'Manual entry' }
);

// Get statistics
const stats = await newAttendanceService.getAttendanceStats('week');
```

## 🗄️ Database Structure

### New Collection: `AttendanceRecords`

```javascript
{
  date: "2025-10-06T00:00:00.000Z",  // Single document per day
  employees: [
    {
      userId: ObjectId("..."),
      events: [
        {
          type: "PUNCH_IN",
          timestamp: "2025-10-06T09:00:00.000Z",
          location: "Office",
          manual: false
        },
        {
          type: "BREAK_START",
          timestamp: "2025-10-06T12:00:00.000Z",
          location: "Break Room"
        }
        // ... more events
      ],
      calculated: {
        workDurationSeconds: 28800,  // 8 hours
        breakDurationSeconds: 3600,  // 1 hour
        isPresent: true,
        isLate: false,
        currentlyWorking: true,
        currentStatus: "WORKING"
      },
      assignedShift: {
        name: "Morning Shift",
        startTime: "09:00",
        endTime: "18:00"
      }
    }
    // ... all other employees for this day
  ],
  dailyStats: {
    totalEmployees: 50,
    present: 45,
    absent: 5,
    late: 3,
    currentlyWorking: 40,
    onBreak: 5
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### 1. Employee Test
```bash
# Login as employee
# Go to Dashboard
# Click "Punch In"
# Wait 5 seconds
# Check work duration updates
# Click "Start Break"
# Wait 5 seconds
# Check break duration updates
# Click "End Break"
# Verify back to working status
```

### 2. Admin Test
```bash
# Login as admin/super-admin
# Go to SuperAdmin Attendance Portal
# Select an employee
# View their attendance
# Check statistics are showing
# Try manual attendance entry
```

### 3. API Test
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/attendance-new/health

# Test today's status (with auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/attendance-new/today
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't punch in
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify token is valid (logout/login)
3. Check server is running
4. Verify `/api/attendance-new` routes are registered

### Issue: Duration not updating
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check WebSocket connection (if using)
4. Verify auto-refresh is working

### Issue: Admin portal shows no data
**Solution:**
1. Check if employees have punched in today
2. Verify date range selection
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Try selecting different employee

### Issue: Old data missing
**Solution:**
- Old UserStatus data still exists in database
- Run migration script if you want to import old data:
  ```bash
  node server/scripts/migrateToNewAttendanceSystem.js
  ```
- Or just start fresh (new system creates records going forward)
