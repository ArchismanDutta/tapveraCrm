# 🔔 Notification Center UI - Build Summary

> **2026-07-16 update:** the UI and data model described here are still
> accurate. The real-time transport underneath (WebSocket delivery,
> `notificationService`) was rebuilt on Socket.IO + Redis with the service
> as the single producer for every feature, not just tasks — see
> `NOTIFICATION_REALTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

  relatedData: {
    leaveId: leave._id,
    url: "/leaves"
  }
});
```

## 📊 Database Schema

```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,          // Recipient
  type: String,              // task, chat, payslip, etc.
  channel: String,           // Notification channel
  title: String,             // Notification title
  body: String,              // Notification body/message
  message: String,           // Alternative message format
  read: Boolean,             // Read status (default: false)
  readAt: Date,              // When marked as read
  priority: String,          // low, normal, high, urgent
  relatedData: {             // Navigation data
    taskId: ObjectId,
    conversationId: ObjectId,
    payslipId: ObjectId,
    leaveId: ObjectId,
    url: String
  },
  delivered: Boolean,        // WebSocket delivery status
  deliveredAt: Date,         // When delivered
  expiresAt: Date,           // Auto-delete date
  createdAt: Date,           // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date            // Last update timestamp
}
```

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**:
   - `userId + read + createdAt` (compound index)
   - `userId + type + createdAt` (compound index)
   - `expiresAt` (TTL index for auto-deletion)

2. **Pagination**: Limits to 20 notifications per page

3. **Auto-Expiry**: Notifications auto-delete after 30 days

4. **Caching**: Unread count cached in frontend, refreshed every 30s

5. **Lazy Loading**: Notifications fetched on-demand
